# CNN Image Classification using TensorFlow

Welcome to the AI-ML-Jupyter-Notebooks repository! This guide will help you navigate and learn CNN Image Classification using TensorFlow. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), you'll find valuable resources to enhance your knowledge and skills.
This is an Introductory Codebase. For deeper knowledge visite [GitHub : DeepLearning-ImageClassification-Toolkit](https://github.com/iSiddharth20/DeepLearning-ImageClassification-Toolkit)

#### TensorFlow is Required to run this Code.
Install using [THIS](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) Guide.
#### Make sure to inastall necessary dependencies by running this command :
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Understanding the Functionalities

### 1. PreProcessing
- Load Dataset from 'DATA_DIR' Directory
- Creates DataFrame containing Full Paths of Images and their Class Labels
- (Change as per Requirement) Rescale Images to Computationally Efficient Resolution
- (Optional but Recommended) Extracts Largest Object from Image using 'image_processing' Function
    - Leverages Parallel Processing for Faster Results
- Compares Original and Rescaled+Processed Image SIde-By-Side to make necessary changes
- Converts Processed Images to NumPy Array and Exports as Pickle File
    - Verifies If Exported Pickle File is Appropriate through 10 Random Samples
- (Optional) Merge Certain Class Lables Together
- Split Data for Training, Testing, Validation with Stratify to ensure data balancing
    - Verify if Split is Appropriate through 2 random samples
- (Optional) Perform Random Oversampling on Data to reduce Biasness
    - Verify if Oversampling is Appropriate through 2 random samples
- Perform One-Hot-Encoding of Class Labels
- Training, Testing, Validation Data and One-Hot-Encoding is Exported as Pickle Files
  
### 2. Training CNN ResNet50
- Training, Testing, Validation Data and One-Hot-Encoding are Imported
    - All Data is converted to TensorFlow Format
- Learning Rate Scheduler is Defined (Change If Desired) 
- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum is Used as Optimizer  (Change If Desired) 
- Added Data Augmentation Techniques to improve Model Learning  (Change If Desired) 
- Base Model (CNN ResNet50) is Loded from TensorFlow Library
    - Custom Optimal Changes have been made to the Structure
    - Final Model is Compiled
- Final Model is Trained
    - Final Model with Lowest Validation Loss is Exported as a '.h5' file
- Traning Time (In Seconds) is Displayed
  
### 3. Verification and Confusion Matrix
- Trained Model and One-Hot-Encoding are Imported
- Entire Dataset is Run through the Trained Model to get Ground Truth of Accuracy
- (Optional) Incorrectly Classified Image Files will be copied to a seprate folder with detected class label
- Ground Truth Classification Confusion Matrix is Created
    - (Optional) Confusion Matrix can be Exported as a '.png' file
 
### HelperFunctions
- Function to display 2 images side-by-side on screen
- Function to Extract largest object from souruce image
